      The Stanford Student Space Initiative is the center of student activities
      involving space exploration and space entrepreneurship at Stanford. We
      believe our future in space is in the process of being reinvented by new,
      private companies and will be more democratized, open, and unbounded than
      ever.

      We help the Stanford community gain the knowledge, experience,
      network, and resources needed to be part of that future and turn their own
      ideas into reality.
